Welcome! I am an economist at the [Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov), focusing on environmental economics and industrial organization. Prior to joining CBO, I worked in antitrust consulting and was a postdoctoral fellow at the [Harvard University Center for the Environment](https://environment.harvard.edu). I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from the [University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/econ) and a B.S. from the [University of Iowa](https://www.uiowa.edu).
